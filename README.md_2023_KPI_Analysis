## **Tools Used**

For my deep dive into the SwapFintech data analysis and KPI's, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

**SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

**PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the SwapFintech data.

**Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

**Power BI:** Essential for visuals utilized during the analysis.

**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaborations and project tracking.

## **The Analysis**

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspect of the SwapFintech KPI's. KPIs identified for the Swap Fintech to track progress and drive business growth include:-

- **Customer Acquisition Rate (C.A.R)**
- **Cusomer Conversion Rate (C.C.R)**
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (M.R.R)**
- **Monthly Retention Rate (R.R)**
- **Churn Rate (C.R)**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (C.L.V)**

### **1. Customer Acquisition Rate (C.A.R)**

**Customer Acquisition Rate (CAR)** measures how many new Bambaswap customers gained in the period 2023 relative to its existing customers. It helps track Bambaswap growth trends and marketing effectiveness.

To calculate the **CAR** we utilized the formula:-

$$
\mathit{CAR} = \frac{\mathit{New\ Customers\ in\ a\ Month}}{\mathit{Total\ Customers\ up\ to\ Current\ Month\ }} \times 100
$$

Where;-

•	**New Customers** - Customers appearing for the first time in a given month.

•	**Total Customers Up to Previous Month** - Customers who existed before that month.

•	Multiplying by 100 converts it into a percentage.

*Here’s the comparative chart of BambaSwap’s Car Acquisition Rate (CAR) for 2023 vs. 2024.
    🔵 2023 (Blue Line): Shows a steady decline throughout the year.
    🔴 2024 (Red Line): Displays extreme volatility, with a massive February spike and a sharp decline after May.
This visualization highlights the early-year surge, mid-year slump, and overall instability in 2024 compared to 2023*

From the analysis and graph respesentation, the following comparative conclusions can be drawn.

    • 2024 saw an extreme spike in CAR to *270.85%* in **February**, compared to *81.00%* in **February 2023**.

    • This suggests a major growth initiative—possibly a new marketing campaign, expanded fleet, or external market conditions driving demand.

1. Mid-Year Drop to 0% in Both Years 📉
    •Acquisition rates fell to 0% by June-July in both 2023 and 2024, indicating a recurring seasonal trend.
    •This could be due to low demand, funding constraints, or operational shifts.
2. 2024 Showed More Extreme Volatility 📊

    •Unlike 2023's steady decline, 2024 had sharp fluctuations—peaking in **February (270.85%)** but then falling dramatically (e.g., *56.64%* in March, *0%* from **June** onward).
    •This suggests unstable market conditions, inconsistent business strategy, or external disruptions affecting growth.

Conclusion on BambaSwap **Car Acquisition Rate (CAR)** Trends (2023 vs. 2024)
BambaSwap’s CAR data for 2023 and 2024 reveals key patterns of growth, decline, and volatility. The massive **February 2024** spike *(270.85%)* suggests an aggressive expansion effort, but the steep drop to *0%* by mid-year in both years highlights a recurring challenge—possibly seasonal demand fluctuations or operational constraints.
Compared to **2023’s steady decline**, 2024 exhibited **high volatility**, indicating either market instability, shifting business strategies, or external disruptions. To sustain long-term growth, BambaSwap should analyze the factors behind these fluctuations, address mid-year declines, and stabilize acquisition efforts throughout the year.

### **2. Customer Conversion Rate (C.C.R)**

**The Customer Conversion Rate (CCR)** measures how many newly acquired BambaSwap customers become engaged customers by making a significant number of transactions (in this case, more than 3 completed transactions).

How is **CCR** Different from **CAR**?

• **Customer Acquisition Rate (CAR)** measures how many new customers are added in a month.

• **Customer Conversion Rate (CCR)** measures how many of those who were customers in previous months come back in the current month.

The formula emoployed to calculate the CCR is :-

$$
\mathit{CCR} = \frac{\mathit{Converted\ Customers\ in\ a\ Month}}{\mathit{Total\ Acquired\ Customers\ in\ the\ Same\ Month\ }} \times 100
$$

•  **Converted Customers** → Customers who completed more than 3 transactions in a given month.

•  **Total Acquired Customers** → Customers who were newly acquired in that month.

What Insights Does This CCR Provide?

• *A High CCR (Near 100%)* → Great retention! Most Bambaswap customers who have used the service before are coming back.

• *A Low CCR (Close to 0%)* → Poor retention! Bambaswap Customers are not returning after their first experience.

• *Fluctuating CCR Trends* → Could indicate Bambaswap seasonal customer behavior or an issue with customer satisfaction.

*Here is a visual comparison of BambaSwap's customer conversion rates for 2023 and 2024. You can see the early-year drop in 2024, the mid-year surge, and the sharp October decline compared to the more stable 2023 trend.*

![BambaSwap Customer Conversion Rate 2024](assets_graph_images\ccr_chart_2023-2024.jpg)

From the above customer conversion anaysis, the following conclusions were made :-

**1. Lower Conversion Rates in Early 2024 Compared to 2023 📉**
    • The first five months of 2024 had significantly lower conversion rates (ranging from *13.51% to 22.26%*) compared to 2023’s much higher rates (*35.11% to 58.41%*).
    • This suggests weaker customer engagement, ineffective marketing, or changes in customer behavior early in 2024.

**2. Mid-to-Late Year Recovery in 2024 🔄**
    • Conversion rates spiked in *June 2024 (62.62%)* and remained above *59%* for most of the second half, similar to 2023’s strong mid-year performance.
    • This indicates a delayed but successful recovery, possibly due to seasonal factors or improved strategies.

**3. October 2024 Drop vs. 2023 Stability 📊**
    • *October 2024* saw a sharp drop *(9.72%)*, whereas October 2023 remained stable at *58.93%*.
    • This suggests an external disruption or internal business changes affecting conversions at that time.

Conclusion on BambaSwap Customer Conversion Rate Trends
BambaSwap’s conversion rate in 2024 started weaker than 2023, indicating early-year challenges in customer acquisition or conversion strategies. However, mid-to-late year performance improved significantly, aligning with historical trends from 2023. The sharp October 2024 drop is an anomaly that should be investigated.
To ensure sustained high conversion rates, BambaSwap should analyze what caused the early-year decline and October drop while reinforcing the factors that led to mid-year improvements.


### **3. Monthly Recurring Revenue (M.R.R)**

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** is a key financial metric that measures the predictable and recurring revenue BambaSwap earns each month from returning customers.

• It excludes one-time payments and focuses only on customers who continue to pay over time.

• For our dataset, **MRR** tracks revenue from customers who have transacted before, (bought airtime) in any previous period and are paying again.

How **MRR** is Different from **Total Revenue**?

• **Total Revenue** - tracks all payments made in a given month, including first-time customers.

• **MRR** - Only revenue from returning customers (customers who have paid before).

*Why This Matters:*

**MRR** is crucial for understanding customer retention and revenue stability. If **MRR** is growing, it means the BambaSwap business is retaining and monetizing existing customers well.

The formula that was employed to calculate the *MMR*:-

$$
\mathit {MMR} = {Sum\ of\ { Total\ Number\ of\ BambaSwap\ Return\ Customers\ in\ Month\ }} \times {\mathit {Average\ Revenue\ Per\ User}}{(A.R.P.U)}
$$

then;

$$
\mathit {MMR} = {Sum\ of\ { Revenue\ from\ Recurring\ Customers\ in\ Month\ }}
$$

Where:

• *Recurring Customers*: Customers who have paid in any previous month and return in current month.

• *Revenue*:The sum of Bambaswap revenue from all returning customers in current month.

*What Insights Can We Get From This MRR Calculation?*

• If **MRR** is growing → More customers are returning and paying again → Good retention & revenue stability.

• If **MRR** is declining → Fewer customers are returning → Possible churn issue.

• If **MRR** fluctuates → Indicates seasonality or inconsistent customer retention trends.

• If **MRR** is *0* in a month with transactions → That month only had new customers (not returning ones).

![BambaSwap Recurring Revenue](assets_graph_images\recurring_chart_2023-2024.jpg)

**1. 2023 Had More Extreme Volatility Compared to 2024 📉📈**
    • 2023 saw massive spikes and crashes in MRR growth, such as *150.91%* in **May** and *-55.08%* in **July**.
    • In contrast, 2024 showed a more gradual decline with smaller fluctuations, except for **November’s** sudden *109.17%* growth.
    • This suggests 2023 had aggressive expansion efforts or external factors driving instability, whereas 2024 followed a more controlled trend.

**2. 2024 Showed a Steady MRR Decline Until November’s Surge 🔻📊**
    • MRR declined consistently from **January** to **May** 2024, before showing modest recovery in mid-year and a sudden spike in **November** *(109.17%).*
    • The November increase could indicate a major revenue boost—possibly from promotions, new product launches, or a change in business model.

**3. 2023's Mid-Year Growth Was Unsustainable ⚠️**
    • In 2023, MRR skyrocketed in **May** *(150.91%)* and **August** *(114.02%)*, but these gains were not sustained.
    • Sharp drops followed *(-51.57% in June, -55.08% in July)*, showing instability.
    • In comparison, 2024’s revenue movements were more controlled, with fewer dramatic shifts.

Conclusion on BambaSwap’s MRR Trends (2023 vs. 2024)
BambaSwap’s 2023 revenue saw extreme fluctuations, suggesting rapid expansion followed by major contractions. In contrast, 2024 had a more stable but declining trend, with a significant November spike.
To ensure consistent revenue growth, BambaSwap should analyze the November 2024 spike to replicate its success, while also identifying the root causes of early-year declines. Avoiding the aggressive expansion-collapse cycle of 2023 will help create long-term financial stability.


### **4. Monthly Retention Rate (M.R.R)**

**The Retention Rate (R.R)** is a key customer success metric that measures the percentage of BambaSwap existing customers who continue paying month after month.

• It tells us how well the bambaswap retains customers over time.

• A high retention rate indicates strong customer loyalty, while a low rate suggests customer churn (customers are leaving).

To calculate the **Retention Rate (R.R)**, we used the following formula:

$$
\mathit {Retention Rate} = (\frac {{\mathit Returning\ Customers\ Month\ m}}{\mathit {Total\ Customers\ in\ Month\ m-1}}) \mathit {\times 100}
$$

Where:

• *Returning Customers in Month m* → Bambaswap Customers who paid in m-1 and continue paying in m.

• *Total Customers in Month m-1* → All unique customers who paid in the previous month.

*What Insights Can We Get From This Query?*

• If Retention Rate is high → Customers continue using the service, indicating strong loyalty.

• If Retention Rate is dropping → Churn rate is increasing, meaning customers are leaving.

• If Retention Rate is 0% for a month → No customers from m-1 returned in m.

• Seasonal Retention Trends → If retention fluctuates, it could be due to seasonal demand or product changes.

*Here is the visual representation of customer retention rates for 2023 and 2024.
    • 2023 shows a steady retention rate above 50%, remaining strong throughout the year.
    • 2024 has high volatility, with zero retention in some months and sudden spikes in others.
This highlights customer retention instability in 2024, which may indicate issues with customer engagement, satisfaction, or external market factors.*

![BambaSwap Retention Rate 2024](assets_graph_images\retention_rate_2023-2024.jpg)

Here are the main insights drawn from the analyzed comparative BambaSwap Retention Rate.

**1. Drastic Drop in Retention Rate in 2024**
    • In 2023, retention rates remained consistently high, mostly above *50%,* and even peaking at *98.20%* in **July.**
    • In 2024, retention rates were highly volatile, with *0%* recorded in **January, June, October, and November**, and massive fluctuations elsewhere *(e.g., 97.20% in July, 99.07% in September)*.
    • This suggests inconsistency in customer engagement or possible operational challenges in 2024.

**2. Sudden Spikes in Mid and Late 2024**
    • While 2024 started with low retention, July, August, and September saw a dramatic recovery, with retention rates exceeding 95%.
    • This could be due to strategic changes, improved customer incentives, or seasonal demand variations.
    
**3. Retention Stability in 2023 vs. Unpredictability in 2024**
    • 2023 showed a gradual increase in retention rates, peaking in **June** *(96.46%)* and **July** *(98.20%)*, with an overall steady customer base.
    • 2024, in contrast, had extreme fluctuations, possibly indicating customer dissatisfaction, pricing changes, or service disruptions.

Conclusion
• 2023 demonstrated strong customer retention, reflecting stable service quality and customer satisfaction.
• 2024's inconsistent retention rates highlight operational challenges, requiring in-depth analysis to identify the causes of sharp drops and sudden spikes.
• Addressing customer churn and enhancing service consistency will be critical to improving retention stability in the coming months.

### **5. Monthly Churn Rate (C.R)**

**Churn Rate** measures the percentage of Bambaswap customers who stop paying from one month to the next. It is the opposite of Retention Rate.

• If Retention Rate is high, Churn Rate is low → Business is retaining customers well.

• If Churn Rate is high, it means many customers are leaving the service.

To calculate the **Churn Rate**, use the following formula:

$$
\mathit{Churn\ Rate}_{(m)} = \frac{\mathit{Customers\ who\ Left\ in\ Month\ m}}{\mathit{Total\ Customers\ in\ Month\ m-1}} \times 100
$$

Where:

• *Churned Customers in Month m* → Customers who paid in m-1 but did not pay in m.

• *Total Customers in Month m-1* → All unique customers who paid in m-1.

*What Insights Can We Get?*

• If Churn Rate is high → Many customers are leaving → Possible retention issues.

• If Churn Rate is low → Customers are staying & continuing to pay.

• If Churn Rate fluctuates → Could indicate seasonal trends or business model changes.

• If Churn Rate is 0% for a month → No customers from m-1 left (great retention).

Here is the sql query used for the churn rate;-

*Here is the churn rate comparison for 2023 and 2024. The blue line represents 2023, while the red dashed line represents 2024.*

![BambaSwap Churn Rate](assets_graph_images\churn_rate_2023-2024.jpg)

BambaSwap churn Rate insight from the above analysis ;-

**1. Churn Rate Volatility in 2024**
    • Unlike 2023, which had a gradual decline in churn rate until **December** (except for a spike in the last month), 2024 experienced extreme fluctuations.
    • Some months in 2024 recorded a *100%* churn rate **(June, October, and December)**, indicating complete customer turnover in those months.
    • The percentage change in churn rate is highly unstable, showing significant negative and positive swings, which suggests customer retention challenges or operational inconsistencies.

**2. Lower and More Stable Churn in 2023**
    • In 2023, churn started high in **February** *(47.34%)* and **March** *(45.36%)* but gradually declined throughout the year.
    • The lowest churn rate was observed between **May and November** *(below 10%)*, implying strong customer retention efforts before a sudden peak in **December** *(99.07%)*.
    • This trend indicates improved customer loyalty as the year progressed, with predictable customer behavior compared to 2024.

**3. Critical Customer Retention Issues in 2024**
    • The sharp rise and fall in churn rate indicate instability in customer engagement strategies.
    • The sudden **100%** churn in multiple months suggests periods of total customer loss, which could be due to external disruptions, service discontinuation, or drastic policy changes.
    • Unlike 2023, which had a gradual improvement in retention, 2024 lacks consistency, making it difficult to maintain long-term customer relationships.

Conclusion
• 2023 had a more predictable and stable churn rate, showing gradual improvement in customer retention strategies.
• 2024 is highly volatile, with sudden spikes in churn and drastic fluctuations in percentage change. This instability suggests critical customer retention challenges, which could be due to service issues, external market disruptions, or ineffective customer engagement strategies.
• Urgent action is needed in 2024 to stabilize customer retention and reduce extreme churn fluctuations.

### **6. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** estimates the total revenue Bambaswap can expect from a single customer over their entire relationship with Bambaswap.

• Higher CLV means customers stay longer and spend more.

• Lower CLV suggests short customer relationships or low spending.

BambaSwap CLV is calculated on a monthly using the formula:-

$$
\mathit {CLV}_{m} = ARPU_m\ \times (\frac {\mathit{1}}{\mathit {Churn\ Rate_m}}) \times 100
$$

where:

• **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** This is calculated as the total revenue in month m divided by the total customers in month m.

• **Churn Rate:** The percentage of customers who did not return in the following month.

*Here is the CLV comparison for 2023 vs. 2024. The blue line represents 2023, showing consistently high CLV, while the red dashed line for 2024 shows a sharp drop early in the year, followed by a late-year increase.*

![BambaSwap CLV & ARPU 2024](assets_graph_images\cvl_2023-2024.jpg)


**1. Drastic Drop in Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) from 2023 to 2024**
    • In 2023, CLV was consistently high, peaking at *ksh. 172,473.93* in **May** and remaining above *ksh. 30,000* in most months.
    • In 2024, CLV saw a sharp decline, dropping below *ksh. 500* except for **June to December**, with the highest at *ksh. 21,982.81* in **November**—a massive shift.
    • This suggests a major change in revenue structure, customer retention, or a shift in business strategy.
**2. Customer Base Shift: Fewer Customers with Higher CLV in Late 2024**
    • Early 2024 had thousands of customers *(e.g., ksh. 5,210 in January)*, but CLV was very low compared to 2023.
    • Mid to late 2024 **(June–December)** saw only *~100-112 customers* per month, but CLV spiked dramatically *(e.g., ksh.21,982.81 in November)*.
    • This suggests a shift from mass-market, low-value customers to a high-value, exclusive customer base.
**3. Revenue Decline but Stabilization in 2024**
    • In 2023, revenue fluctuated widely, peaking at *ksh. 5.14M* in **May** and then dropping.
    • 2024 revenue was much lower and more stable, except for **November** and **December**, which saw spikes.
    • This could indicate a change in pricing models, customer contracts, or a reduction in service offerings.

Conclusion
• Bambaswap underwent a major shift in customer strategy from 2023 to 2024.
• 2023 was **high-revenue, high-CLV**, but with a smaller customer base.
• 2024 started with mass customers at low CLV but pivoted mid-year to fewer, high-value customers.
• Revenue became more stable in 2024 but remains lower than 2023 overall.

## CONCLUSION
BambaSwap’s performance trends in 2023 and 2024 reveal critical insights into customer acquisition, engagement, and revenue stability. While 2023 showed steady declines and predictable patterns, 2024 experienced extreme volatility, indicating operational and market uncertainties. The sharp fluctuations in retention and churn rates, combined with inconsistent revenue trends, highlight the need for a more stable customer engagement strategy. To ensure long-term growth, BambaSwap must address seasonal demand fluctuations, improve customer retention efforts, and maintain a consistent acquisition strategy to avoid the extreme swings observed in 2024. Strengthening these areas will enhance business sustainability and drive predictable, long-term success.
